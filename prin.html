The strong values and traditions of Agra College enable our students to inherit a strong foundation to march ahead and contribute for a stronger and brighter India. Character development and leadership are just as important to us as academic results. Over the past academic years the College has developed and grown with an amazing pace in every conceivable area. New and innovative courses in Bio technology, Commerce and Journalism have been started. Also the introduction of Civil and Electrical branches at the under graduate level and the M. Tech course in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology indicate the commitment of the college to an expensive vision. It is no small achievement that the FET has become today the first choice of all aspirants for the B. Tech programme in the region. Catering to the need of the hour, the College has moved beyond its traditional mould by harnessing itself to the boons of the technological and digital revolution. The college has been wi-fi enabled, CCTV cameras and smart class rooms have been installed and laboratories have been upgraded with state of the art technology.
